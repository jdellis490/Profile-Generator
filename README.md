# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This project creates a HTML webpage using a back end node command. Using prompts from npm packages, the user
can answer questions to help build a team profile. Npm jest was also used to test the functionality of the code 
within the main index file. This project helped me understand back end commands a bit more and a taste of 
how to write tests to test one's code.

## Installation

To intall one must run `npm init -y` and `npm install inquier` from the terminal. Then simply type `node index.js`
and follow the prompts in the terminal

## Tests

To test, type `npm install --save-dev jest` in the terminal and `npm test` all from within the terminal.
